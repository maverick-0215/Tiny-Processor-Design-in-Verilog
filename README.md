# Tiny-Processor-Design-in-Verilog
This project was completed as part of the final assignment for a Digital Systems course. It includes the Verilog implementation of a 8-bit processor with the following components:

-ALU

-Registers (including Accumulator, EXT register, Register File)

-Instruction Set and Instruction Decoding

-Control Flow Logic

The processor's functionality is verified using a comprehensive testbench. The full code and simulation results are present in the attached project report.
